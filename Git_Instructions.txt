How to set up the newest git:

Debian/Ubuntu Linux: sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade && sudo apt-get install git
RHEL/CentOS Linux: sudo yum update && sudo yum install yum-cron && sudo yum install git

Mac OS X:
1. /usr/bin/ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"
2. brew doctor      then follow instructions
3. brew install python python3 ruby git git-lfs

An overview of Git commands:

To clone a repository:
1. Go to the repo on github and find the ssh clone link
2. Navigate in terminal to the directory where you would like to place the repo locally
3. git clone <ssh link here>

To see what's changed locally since the last commit you fetched:
1. Go to git repo root
2. git status

To see the differences in a file:
1. git diff <file>

To add files for commit:
1. git status to see changes
2. git add <file> <file> <file> (or git rm <removed_file>)
2b. To adopt all changes use git add -A (be careful with this)

To make a commit:
1. add all desired files (see above)
2. git commit -m "<a short summary of your changes about this long>"

To push to github:
1. make a commit (see above)
2. git push

To add a large file (10's mb to gb):
1. git lfs install
2. git lfs track <file>
3. add, commit, and push as normal

To fetch changes on all branches in the repo:
1. git fetch

To pull changes locally:
1. git fetch
2. git pull (on the branch you want to pull)

To switch to a different (existing) branch:
1. make sure you are caught up on your current branch (no outstanding changes)
2. git checkout <branch name>

To create a new branch:
1. make sure you are caught up on your current branch (no outstanding changes)
2. git checkout -b <branch name>

Merging branches:
You'll learn later (ask in person, can be tricky)
